# About 

This SortMaster project is a web application that visualizes different sorting algorithms in real-time. 
It allows users to select an algorithm (such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort), set the array size and sorting speed, and then watch as the algorithm sorts the array visually. 
The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing an interactive and educational tool to understand the sorting process.
